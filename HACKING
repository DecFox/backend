This document explains how to contribute to the ooni-probe or at least, it
should someday!

Getting started:

  git clone this code somewhere useful

The general gist is that hackers should:

  Follow standard python conventions
  Always ensure that the 'master' branch is in a working state
  Documentation all code with what it does
  Create tests when possible
  Always create branches for work in progress
  Communicate with other developers about your ideas
  If you're not sure what to hack on, check out the TODO file
  Scope your commits to specific feature patches when pushing to master
  Write useful commit messages
 
Send patches!
