    This represents an OONI Report as stored in the database.

    report_id: this is generated by the backend and is used by the client to
               reference a previous report and append to it. It should be
               treated as a shared secret between the probe and backend.

    software_name: this indicates the name of the software performing the test
                   (this will default to ooniprobe)

    software_version: this is the version number of the software running the
                      test.

    test_name: the name of the test on which the report is being created.

    test_version: indicates the version of the test

    progress: what is the current progress of the report. This allows clients
              to report event partial reports up to a certain percentage of
              progress. Once the report is complete progress will be 100.

    content: what is the content of the report. If the current progress is less
             than 100 we should append to the YAML data structure that is
             currently stored in such field.
