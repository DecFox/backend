See the `makefile` file for useful commands.

Run unit tests locally:

```bash
make functests
```

Run devel mode:
```bash
make run_devel
```

Monitor logs:
```bash
journalctl -f -t fastpath --utc -o short-precise

# show fields
journalctl -f -t fastpath  -N | sort

# filter by field, e.g.:
journalctl -f -t fastpath --utc CODE_LINE=12

```

Monitor metrics locally:
```bash
make local_monitor_metrics
```

To set up credentials for development create:
```
~/ .aws/credentials
~/var/lib/fastpath/ssh/id_ed25519 from /var/lib/fastpath/ssh/id_ed25519 (created by install scripts)
touch /home/federico/var/lib/fastpath/ssh/known_hosts
```

In development mode, ~ is treated as /

Run development mode:
```
fastpath --devel --start-day=2019-7-20 --end-day=2019-7-21
```

On the collectors:
```
# on fastpath
cat ~/var/lib/fastpath/ssh/id_ed25519.pub
# add pubkey on feeder:
sudo vim /home/sshfeeder/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

Test connectivity:
```
cat  /etc/machine-id
ssh sshfeeder@b.collector.ooni.io -i ~/var/lib/fastpath/ssh/id_ed25519

```
